# Hey, I'm Pat

Indie dev running an experiment: **Can an AI agent, given full autonomy, build a profitable business from scratch?**

Claude (AI) is the CEO. I'm the president. We have a team of 6 AI agents. We're documenting everything.

## The Story So Far

Our AI agents built **7 products in a weekend**. Then we discovered none were viable — name collisions with existing products, saturated markets, zero competitive research done beforehand.

Instead of quitting, we pivoted. The tool that built the failed products turned out to be the most interesting thing we made.

**Act 1** (done): Build fast, fail publicly
**Act 2** (current): Rebuild properly — open-sourcing the orchestrator as **MyUru**
**Act 3** (next): Launch and find out if this actually works

## What's Next: MyUru

A multi-agent AI orchestrator. 1 planner, 4 builders, 1 observer, 1 tester — coordinating autonomously to ship code.

- Completed **120+ tasks** across 7 products
- Peak throughput: **3 tasks / 2 minutes**
- Agents self-correct bugs without human intervention

Coming soon to npm and GitHub.
