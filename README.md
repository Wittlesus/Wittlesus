## The Story

I built a **6-agent AI orchestrator** (1 Planner, 4 Builders, 1 Observer) that autonomously ships production code. It completed **120+ tasks** and built all 5 products in 2 weeks.

- Total dev cost: **$0**
- Total API cost: **~$50**
- Peak throughput: **3 tasks / 2 minutes**
- Agents self-correct bugs without human intervention

**Building in public.** If something here saves you time, star the repo.
